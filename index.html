      <h3>Books</h3>
      <img src="" alt="a picture of the orange book cover with stars on the far left 
      side of it (if the book is facing you) of American Hemp by Jenn Hobbs" />
      <p> This publication is available as an eBook in multiple formats as well as
        a print edition through Amazon</p>
      <p> The book American Hemp explores the many uses for this crop, 
        what makes it a superior commodity, and why it was deemed illegal in the first 
        place. It also explores the many health and medical advantages of the plant. 
        Hobbs offers her opinion on how hemp may advance several industries, including 
        farming, energy production, and 3D printing, as well as how it can significantly 
        reduce climate change by eliminating toxins from the soil and reducing our 
        reliance on plastics and fossil fuels.</p>
